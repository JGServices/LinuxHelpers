sudo ufw app list

Here’s what each of these profiles mean:

Apache: This profile opens only port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic).
Apache Full: This profile opens both port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic) and port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic).
Apache Secure: This profile opens only port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic).
For now, it’s best to allow only connections on port 80, since this is a fresh Apache installation and you don’t yet have a TLS/SSL certificate configured to allow for HTTPS traffic on your server.

To only allow traffic on port 80, use the Apache profile:

sudo ufw allow in "Apache"

sudo ufw status
